## Research field C: Technological drivers/factors

Research Field C concentrates on technological drivers and factors such as innovative information and communication services and focuses on _Car-to-X communication (C1)_ and _Dynamic maps and map services (C2)_. These technological factors provide general information and functions for (de-&#x2060)centralized cooperative traffic management.
